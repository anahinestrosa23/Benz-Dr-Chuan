    <h4>The all-new 2021 GLA SUV </h4>
    Drive further. Ride higher. Live better.
    <h4>DESIGN</h4>
    More than a commanding view of the road ahead, the new second-generation GLA offers a rewarding view of what's next. It not only puts more sport in compact SUVs, it puts more you.
    <h4>VERSATILITY</h4>
    From a tight corner of the city, to a tight corner of a back road, the GLA is agile and easy to maneuver. Turbo power and a solid stance make it quick on its feet, confident in your hands.
    <h4>INNOVATION</h4>
    People are talking. The Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) drives a new generation of user-friendly tech. Its natural, intuitive speech interface is easy to learn because it can learn you.

    <h4>The all-new GLC SUV</h4>
    Upright design. Downright sporty. And just right for everything you do.
    <h4>DESIGN</h4>
    Has any SUV ever fit so much into such a compact package? Accommodating, with seating for up to seven. Rugged in all the right places, with looks to match. So intelligent it can carry on a conversation, and carry out your wishes. And all priced to please.
    <h4>VERSATILITY</h4>
    It can take you new places, or make old favorite roads feel fresh. It can take up to six of your friends, or make easy work of the weekend chores. And wherever you take it, it'll do more than you expect to make every mile memorable.  
    <h4>INNOVATION</h4>
    If you like how the GLB looks, you'll love how it listens. The Mercedes-Benz User Experience is your own in-car personal assistant. Just say what you want, and your wish is literally your GLB's command. MBUX can quietly respond to your touch, too.

    <h4>GLC SUV</h4>
    The head of the class leaps ahead.
    <h4>DESIGN</h4>
    Benchmarks can't be benched. So the standard-setting GLC SUV enters 2020 with sleeker style and smarter tech. All-LED lighting helps you see and be seen. Fresh details, clean lines and sporty proportions make sure you look great, too.
    <h4>PERFORMANCE</h4>
    The turbo GLC 300 and plug-in hybrid GLC 350e with EQ Power are both energetic and energy-conscious. They embrace the road and your passion for driving with composed comfort and a feeling of confident control. And they reassert the "sport" in SUV.
    <h4>INNOVATION</h4>
    The GLC's new intelligent voice assistant turns conversational language into cockpit control. The richly tailored cabin wraps state-of-the-art innovation in artful design, pairing sensible benefits with sensory delights.
